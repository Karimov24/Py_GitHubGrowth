#Python can also perform exponentiation. In written math, you might see an exponent as a superscript number, 
# but typing superscript numbers isnâ€™t always easy on modern keyboards. Since this operation is so related to multiplication, 
# we use the notation **.

# Calculation of squares for:
# 6x6 quilt
print(6 ** 2 )
# 7x7 quilt
print (7 ** 2)
# 8x8 quilt
print(8 **2)
# How many squares for 6 people to have 6 quilts each that are 6x6?
print(6 * 6 * 6 * 6)
